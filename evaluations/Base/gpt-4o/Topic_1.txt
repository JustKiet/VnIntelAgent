## Types of SEO Content

There are several types of content that can be optimized for SEO. Each serves a specific purpose and appeals to different parts of the buyer's journey.

### 1. **Blog Posts**
Blog posts are the cornerstone of SEO content. They provide in-depth, actionable information on topics relevant to your audience. For example:

These are standalone pages designed to capture leads or drive conversions. Landing pages are typically optimized around high-value keywords and serve as the entry point for potential customers.

Comprehensive resources or "pillar content" that cover a topic in detail. These guides often include multiple sections and provide immense value, encouraging backlinks from other sites.

### 5. **Infographics**
Visual content like infographics can simplify complex data and make it shareable. Pairing visuals with optimized text ensures the content is search-engine friendly.

### 6. **Videos**
Search engines like Google increasingly prioritize video content. Optimizing video titles, descriptions, and tags can boost visibility.

Case studies showcase real-world applications of your products or services. They rank well for long-tail keywords and establish trust with potential customers.
