    "reason": "The article effectively addresses the input keyword 'What is Explainable AI (XAI)?' and stays focused on the topic, satisfying evaluation steps 1 and 3. However, it only contains 1269 words, failing the requirement for a minimum of 2000 words, impacting the completeness as per the input instructions. Additionally, while the context is adequately covered, the article lacks depth in some areas, such as providing more detailed examples or case studies, which could enhance its comprehensiveness in line with the context."
