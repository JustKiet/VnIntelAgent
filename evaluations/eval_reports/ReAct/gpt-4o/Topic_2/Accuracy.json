    "reason": "The article provides a general overview of AI agents but lacks specific details and examples from the context such as agentic versus non-agentic AI chatbots, ReAct and ReWOO paradigms, and feedback mechanisms. The article's coherence is somewhat supported, but it is only 1248 words long, falling short of the required 2000 words."
