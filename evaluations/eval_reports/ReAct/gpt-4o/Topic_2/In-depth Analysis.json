    "reason": "The article provides a comprehensive overview of AI agents, covering definitions, types, and applications, aligning well with the input keyword. However, it falls short of the 2000-word requirement, missing depth in some areas compared to the context information provided. The coherence and logical flow are maintained, but the exploration of advanced themes like tool integration and feedback mechanisms is less detailed than expected."
