    "reason": "The actual output adequately addresses the input keyword 'OpenAI Structured Output' and maintains focus on it, discussing its significance and applications. However, the article is only 1023 words, not meeting the minimum 2000-word requirement. Additionally, while it aligns well with the context, it lacks depth in exploring the specific implementation details and advancements covered in the context such as function calling and response format options. Overall, the article maintains relevance but falls short in length and depth."
