    "reason": "The actual output aligns with the input by focusing on 'OpenAI Structured Output' and maintains a professional tone. However, the word count is 1023, which is less than the required 2000 words, and it lacks detailed exploration of YMYL topics and E-E-A-T guidelines. The writing style is clear and engaging, and it simplifies complex concepts effectively, but the length and depth are insufficient relative to the input's demands."
