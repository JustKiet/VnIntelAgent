    "reason": "The article provides a good overview of OpenAI Structured Output but is only 1023 words long, failing the 2000-word requirement. It also omits specific details from the context, such as the introduction of Structured Outputs at DevDay and the comparison between model performances. Additionally, it doesn't mention the new response_format parameter and native SDK support, which are crucial to understanding the feature."
