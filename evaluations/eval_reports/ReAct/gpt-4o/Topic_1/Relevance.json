    "reason": "The article clearly identifies and defines the keyword 'SEO Content' and directly addresses it by explaining its significance, types, and creation strategies. However, the article falls short of the 2000-word requirement, with only 1251 words, and lacks a focus on avoiding unrelated information as specified. The context is maintained but not fully extensive as expected."
