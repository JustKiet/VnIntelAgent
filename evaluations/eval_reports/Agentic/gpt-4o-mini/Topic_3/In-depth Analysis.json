    "reason": "The article addresses the keyword 'Explainable AI (XAI)' directly and covers main topics such as definitions, need, principles, techniques, applications, challenges, and future directions, aligning with the evaluation steps. However, the depth of information is moderate, lacking extensive supporting data or diverse expert opinions. It provides contextual background, enhancing understanding. The conclusion summarizes key points but could better encapsulate the significance and implications of XAI. The content meets some requirements but falls short of the specified 2000-word length, offering 1008 words."
