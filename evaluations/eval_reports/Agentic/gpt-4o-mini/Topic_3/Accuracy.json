    "reason": "The output partially aligns with the context by correctly describing XAI's goals and challenges, but it only contains 1008 words, missing the 2000-word minimum requirement. Furthermore, the output lacks depth in areas covered by the context, such as historical development and specific technical methods like LRP and DeepDream, and fails to mention XAI's role in social choice theory."
