    "reason": "The article discusses the key aspects of Explainable AI, covering its methods, challenges, and use cases. However, it falls short of the 2000-word requirement, limiting the depth of analysis. Relevant details and insights are included but are not as comprehensive as requested in the input. The context of XAI is adequately supported, yet the overall length and detail do not fully align with the input criteria."
