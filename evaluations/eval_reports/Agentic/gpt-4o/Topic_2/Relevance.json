    "reason": "The keyword 'What is an AI Agent?' is prominently featured in the title and sections of the output, but the article is only 942 words long, significantly below the required 2000 words. While the content is relevant to the keyword, it lacks depth and completeness, impacting its adherence to the input criteria. Additionally, the output does not stray into unrelated topics but fails to meet the length requirement for a fully optimized SEO article."
