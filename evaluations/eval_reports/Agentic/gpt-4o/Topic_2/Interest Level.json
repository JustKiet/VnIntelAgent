    "reason": "The output is professional and follows SEO guidelines, but it is only 942 words, far short of the 2000-word requirement. It includes engaging content on AI agents, aligning with user interest. However, it lacks the expected depth and comprehensive coverage due to its brevity. The language and structure are appropriate for an expert SEO writer, but the incomplete length significantly impacts its overall score."
