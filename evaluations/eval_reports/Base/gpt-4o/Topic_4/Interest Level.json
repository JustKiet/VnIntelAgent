    "reason": "The Actual Output aligns with the topic 'What is OpenAI Structured Output?' but fails to meet the 2000-word requirement outlined in Input. The content is engaging and well-structured, adhering to a professional tone. However, it lacks specific references to the Context details about the API's JSON Schema, reducing its relevance. The language is clear, but the unmet word count and lack of deeper Context integration lower the score."
