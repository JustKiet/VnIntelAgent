    "reason": "The article adequately addresses the keyword 'What is an AI Agent?' and maintains focus on AI agents, discussing their characteristics, types, and applications. However, it falls short of the 2000-word requirement, limiting depth. Some sections are brief, and the context regarding LLMs and agentic technology is underexplored, which affects the comprehensiveness expected for SEO optimization."
