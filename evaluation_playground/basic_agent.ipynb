To offer a more efficient solution for developers, we\\u2019re also releasing OpenAI o1-mini, a faster, cheaper reasoning model that is particularly effective at coding. ChatGPT Plus and Team users will be able to access o1 models in ChatGPT starting today. Developers who qualify for API usage tier 5(opens in a new window) can start prototyping with both models in the API today with a rate limit of 20 RPM. We also plan to continue developing and releasing models in our GPT series, in addition to the new OpenAI o1 series.\"}, {\"url\": \"https://www.techtarget.com/WhatIs/feature/OpenAI-o1-explained-Everything-you-need-to-know\", \"content\": \"OpenAI's o1 models, launched in September 2024, enhance reasoning in AI and excel in complex tasks, such as generating and debugging code. The o1 models are initially intended to be preview models, designed to provide users -- as well as OpenAI -- with a different type of LLM experience than the GPT-4o model. OpenAI o1 can perform many tasks like any of OpenAI's other GPT models -- such as answering questions, summarizing content and generating new content. The o1 models are optimized for complex reasoning tasks, especially in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
